# docker-compose.relay.yml - Sovereign Agent Relay Server
#
# This runs ONLY the relay service (not the full agent).
# Use this on your trusted server (Pi, home server, etc.)
#
# Quick start:
#   1. Copy config.json.example to config.json
#   2. Add your OpenRouter API key
#   3. Set relay.enabled=true and relay.mode=server
#   4. docker compose -f docker-compose.relay.yml up -d
#
# The relay will:
#   - Listen on localhost:8080 (SSH tunnel required for remote access)
#   - Forward requests to OpenRouter with your API key
#   - Track request/token statistics
#
# Security:
#   - Bind to 127.0.0.1 only (clients connect via SSH tunnel)
#   - Only whitelisted API paths are forwarded
#   - API key never exposed to clients
